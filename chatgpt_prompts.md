# ChatGPT Prompts Used

Below is a clear record of how I used ChatGPT to assist in designing, planning, and packaging this solution for the Symplique Solutions Azure Engineer assignment.

---

## üéØ Problem Understanding

- *"Explain how to optimize costs for large, read-heavy Azure Cosmos DB data sets."*
- *"Suggest a simple, production-friendly serverless architecture for archiving old billing records in Azure."*

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure & Automation

- *"Give me an example Terraform configuration to deploy Cosmos DB and Blob Storage in Azure."*
- *"Show a pseudocode example for an Azure Function to move old records from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage."*

---

## üìå Design & Diagram

- *"Help me outline an architecture diagram showing API fallback from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage."*
- *"Step-by-step instructions to make the diagram using draw.io."*

---

## üîó GitHub & Submission

- *"How do I create a GitHub repository and push local files using Git Bash?"*
- *"How do I link a diagram image in README.md?"*
- *"Guide me through final checks so my repo is clean and complete."*

## ‚úÖ Why I Used AI

I used ChatGPT as a productivity assistant to:
- Validate my technical approach
- Get examples and templates quickly
- Ensure clear structure, documentation, and presentation
- Save time on repetitive tasks (syntax, diagram layout, markdown structure)

The final solution design and decisions are mine, using AI as a **tool**, not a replacement.
